#Report Card

This application stores the result of 4 different students.

The first page displays the list of the students and upon clicking the name of the student it displays the result of the student.

The Project has a ReportCardClass that is a model class for the result of a student which stores the name and marks of individual student. It also extends Parcelable because the object is used to pass to the Intent.
