#Court Counter

This project keeps the track of the scores of competing teams in a Basketball match.

Functionality:

1) You can update One, Two or Three Pointer.
2) You can reset the scores. Pressing on the RESET Button will reset the scores of both the teams.
3) Even if you happen to rotate your screen, the data will not be lost and the UI would also retain the values. onSaveInstance() and onRestoreInstance() have been overridden to ensure that data is not lost even when the configuration changes from portrait to landscape.
